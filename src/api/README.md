# About the API

Instead of having our components and services make API calls to the server directly, we want to create a layer in between.

We will use the Axios library, one of the most popular promise based clients for performing API calls. Even though we will use Axios, keep in mind that the same approach can be used for any HTTP method (xhr, fetch) or client (Firebase, Amplify, etc.).
